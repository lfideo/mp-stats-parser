# mp-stats-parser
A demonstration of how you can use Python to get lots of useful data from API. This script overcomes the limitations 
of default server settings, and is flexible enough to choose what category you want to download, 
as well as the date range that you are interested in.

As of now, the script lacks the `async` functionality, which would reduce the script running time, and increase the amount of API calls.
